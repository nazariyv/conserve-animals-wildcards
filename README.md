# Wildcards streamlined art submission

Uses 3Box's threads per animal that are publicly open. Here you have IPFS hashes and metadata about the submission, such as artist, submission comment, and any other pinata metadata.

When the user submits art, a private (in the sense that noone except the admin and the submitter can edit it) thread for communication purposes.

The artist has the ability to make a submission from their own panel, or from the home page. Once submitted, it is added to their table of submissions, where they can also see the status of their submissions.

Next, it is admins who give feedback in the private thread and change the status of the submission accordingly.
